# Overview

The iCLIP.intron_analysis workflow quantifies the enrichment of iCLIP in intron of
circRNAs. Here, first an intron database is constructed from
a decided set of rules. Then introns are assigned to the feature sets. Finally,
centrality and enrichment are computed.

- Centrality is described in Carrasco et al. 2020.
- Enrichment follows an idea in iCount, Curk et al. (2019) iCount.

# Setup the YAML:

Require categories in the YAML:
- resources, circRNA_targets,gene_targets
Each category is a list of items, which requires <key>: <path to file>.

* <path to file> needs to be the absolute path.
* For the 'circRNA_targets', each <key> needs to finish with '_targets'

Further variable w/ example:
- gene_biotypes: protein_coding
- intron_maxgap: 10
- exon_boundaries: 10
- circRNA_merge_distance: 10
- intron_size_thrs: 50

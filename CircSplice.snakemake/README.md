Here is the code to run CircSplice with snakepipe.
Workflow:
1. Make refFlag file from USCS genome with the make_refFlat.R script.
2. Download snakefile, .pl script from https://github.com/GeneFeng/CircSplice, run with run.sh.

I did some change from the original CircSplice.pl file to make it compatible with snakemake.
